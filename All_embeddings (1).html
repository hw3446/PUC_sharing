The scene was about low rolling hills, no trees, no animals and I was there, alone, owning the space and the fleeting time.","Children playing on the shore of a river. Small children laughing and playing.","The sprightly manner in which the Takács played the first movement brought to mind a specific memory. My wife and I were walking on a hillside in the Adirondack region of NY State when we came upon a swarm of dragonflies flying around each other in a sunny spot. There were dozens of them, never leaving that sunny spot for as long as we gazed at them. All the same species. They seemed to be enjoying each other.","Happy, sunny, uplifting. We often listened to uplifting classical happy music during breakfast with our children growing up, reminds me of a happy, bright start to the day. Also, spending many springs in London, visiting gardens, galleries and museums.","Romantic and dramatic story. Dancing woman and man.","A lush pasture with the sun shining; then a storm brewing, and finally clearing.","Shorebirds running, exploring, frolicking, skirmishing, wading to and for at the beach.","Scene of children at play, throwing a ball around, having a little spat, laughing and yelling at each other.","Memory of dinner. Thought of what will happen to Kennedy Centre.","Memories of playing violin in past with friends — spent a lot of time playing chamber music gave me interest in playing music again.","I had a vivid memory of listening to this very quartet repeatedly in my second year of university in the music listening room of the library when we had just LPs!","I remember playing this piece as a second violinist with a group of friends in Philadelphia. The memories were the strongest with the first movement, and I thought more about the way the instruments interacted, and the skill of the performers on the stage, for the rest of the piece.","As I enjoyed the beginning movement, my appreciation of the incredible skills and communication between the players made me remember other string quartets I have heard (where the musicians were not as expressive). Examples came to mind — summer music festivals on an island, attempts at playing Beethoven quartets with 3 other string players, and even other concerts here. Memories of my super-amateur playing compared to these formidable musicians.","The Beethoven seemed to begin as a frolic on a beautiful summer's day. Dancing, conversing, enjoying the outdoors, seated on the grass in a park. Noise surrounds with the warmth of the sun, twittering insects, butterflies, and the swaying of trees. Couples begin to pair off as the time passes having more intimate conversations as the day passes slowly to noon and eventually to sunset and evening.","Running\u002fdistress. Mostly evokes feelings of racing towards a goal and not succeeding.","Brought back childhood memories because my mother introduced me to classical music.","A conversation and movement between characters actively trying to problem solve or gossip — gossiping women....People in a park — on a bench.","I remember performing with a trio and the interaction of my fellow performers.","It was a reminder, very vivid, of the brief time when I took piano lessons. The tempo of the piece brought the memory. I don't remember the piece.","The repetition reminds me of a poem or song where the refrain is repeated time again, as in a children's story where a line 'good night moon' is repeated time and again.","There is a family of giant winged metallic insects in a large dining room. They are having a conversation. Sometimes they argue, sometimes they converse, sometimes they laugh.","Though the memory I thought of was not the longest sustained, it was the most intense. I imagined practicing a Beethoven Sonata in B-flat, I think when I was younger and in music school. I could almost feel my fingers twitching as I listened, and the environment of the old practice room was vivid.","I was thinking a lot about my grandparents, who introduced me to classical music, which has become a very important part of my life. I was thinking about spending time at Tanglewood with them, listening to great music in a beautiful outdoor setting.","Learning the violin. Holding the violin, loving the violin and wishing I still played. Planning to buy a violin and take lessons again. Seeing the violin as a beautiful appendage — not separate from by body. Watching the movement of the musicians' bodies as they played. Remembering how it felt to play and how the violin prompts one to sway — how the notes and the sounds are visceral.","A boy aged about four, who when he heard a cello for the first time burst into tears with heavy sobs. Then, almost immediately, a memory, about the other end of life: my grandmother. At a concert she knew would probably be the last she would ever attend, bursting into tears. The music was Beethoven's ninth symphony.","As if I was part of a Monet painting. I was a little girl in a long white dress and a ribbon smelling the flowers.","I play the violin and have played regularly with a string quartet that sight reads every Saturday morning. The first movement of the Beethoven brought back many memories of this quartet experience. That I no longer have as I have moved.","Beethoven movement 1 conjured a memory of my brother (this part wasn't in the UK) learning to crawl on Easter day years ago, crawling for a plate of sweet tarts that ended up on the floor, then it went to Beatrix Potter Peter Cottontail Movie and its pastels. Then what I imagined when I read Wuthering Heights — rainy hills of heather.","It is very noble music, I was imaging people were sort of gathering in a party at a court. Many conversations questions between the ladies and gentlemen who were invited to the party.","Playing with cousin's at summer house in Sweden;.","Remembering when I played the piece myself.","Visualized people dancing.","Call and response, conversations. Sometimes between birds, sometimes between people... Teasing and calling out.","The amazing physical involvement of the musicians with each other and with the music reminded me of playing music myself in high school band. The harmonic relationships are what we need in our world today. We should be able to peacefully and joyfully interact with others, so sad that it is lacking today in our world.","I had images of free flowing things like vines over tranquil pools. The scene was both peaceful and full of life. These seemed both prompted by memories of willows and also entirely newly created within my mind.","I was a young man, think I was in a hot air balloon. First I saw children playing and laughing. Then I saw people dancing. Then runners in a marathon. Then horses grazing in the grass. The I was making love to my wife in the field.","It was playing in orchestra. Trying to learn cello fingering. The disappointment that I didn't want to practice. And that in sixth grade our school had a guess where we'd end up. Mine was a concert cellist (I'm not).","Wailing of violins in concert halls, with wet pavement outside — from Paul Jennings, British columnist & humanist, noted for \"oddly\" book series.","I had a vision of the scene that happened long time ago, when Beethoven just composed this Quartet, and it was a premier. How he listened critically at the first performance of his creation. I imagined the feelings he could have.","I remembered living in France 15 years ago. Specifically, I remembered walking up the steps in Montmartre toward Sacre Coeur.","I realized that daydreams don't come naturally to me — but when I tried to think of a specific fictional imagining, I imagined galloping horses in the countryside during a bright sunny vividly green day.","I imagined a scene during Beethoven's time. In the scene a beautiful lady walks in the garden of a grand mansion. The garden is well maintained and full of colorful flowers.","Previous attendance at a classical music concert — in fact, Takács playing Beethoven.","Pleasant walks through nature.","Reminded me of a kind of bad movie about Beethoven that I watched once, not necessarily the memory I would've chosen but there it was.","Children playing in a field, summertime.

Perhaps animals or perhaps people. No story developed. The imaginings continued with no narrative.","I enjoyed the music. Occasionally I thought of the papers I'm grading.","Journey through woods, encountering sunlit glades and some dark regions filled with shadows — but then emerging back onto the path and seeing birds and flowers.","Sadness of the tragedy of Romeo and Juliet. The couple in love — thwarted. Sadness; darkness; conflict. Not too many images. Did not see their faces only gestures, shadows, darkness.","Reminded me of a late night conversation among four friends covering topics of personal, professional and political. The emotions are coursing and confrontational at times but still very conflicted.","A memory of first time I saw Takács Quartet in Boston late 80s or early 90s. Wondered if any are the original musicians. Decided no. Distracted by woman's horrible posture. She will be sorry when she's old. Appreciated Beethoven second movement. Most other movements were like music for Saturday morning cartoons. Impatient with 200 year old music.","Walking down a country lane on an autumn evening, listening and experiencing the natural environment. Bird and small animal sounds, sensations of flickering sunlight through trees and increasing darkness.","I thought about a dream I had last night about my brother and his family. We are going through an estrangement. He is a musician and in the dream we were at a sale of giant refurbished bells and horns in a field.","I saw a sea and a ship with fish beneath.","I'm watching a small band of soldiers walk down the street of a bombed-out city during WWII. It was all gray. Facades were still standing, but lots of rubble. Like a scene from 'Saving Private Ryan' or something.","Walking through the countryside near Princeton, forest, dead leaves, bare trees, snow, mist.","An old photo album discovered in an attic — a photo of a woman from the 1920's. We miss her and then we are walking down stone stairs down down to underground passageways beneath the earth. So many roots and networks of roots becoming organic abstractions. Fungi communicating. The woman from the photo was buried here and became a part of this expansive underground network. We merge with her here.","Imagined seeing a large field out in nature of water flowing — focusing on individual droplets of water.","I remembered the very relaxing and positive images from my trip the week before to Austin, Texas.","I remembered someone a couple of years behind me in grade school (~1950) and the house where she lived, then when a US senator of the same family name came to my parents house for a social occasion — drinks before lunch, I think. I have no idea why I should remember this! No other thoughts. This was during the Beethoven probably movement 2, maybe 3. The most coherent vision was of the bridge over the Charles River on the road to this person's house (a house I never visited, but I knew where it was).","At adagio, an image of rain pouring down a wood-framed window.","Sleep in summer night. When you are sleeping outside under the stars.","For some reason in the second movement of the first piece I thought of a childhood friend with whom I am not in touch anymore. Her parents are buried two rows away from mine and I imagined running into her at the cemetery. Usually I try to concentrate on the music — the players, themes, currents. Although today is the anniversary of my mother's death.","I remembered being in Vienna years ago and seeing scenes that Beethoven could have seen. I did research on salons and I remember scenes\u002f sketches from books where he would have played or his work would have been performed.","The rhythm of color and shapes.","It brought back the memories of the conversation I had with my friends group. We talked about the string quartet music itself how we liked it. Also talked about the first time we heard it. Talked a lot about our childhood & the music we were exposed to thanks to our parents. (Smell of coffee, too) — because we also talked about it.","I remember playing second violin in the piece — the drama, the long long long lines — the cry of despair in the first violin. The pleas of all of the voices.","The agitation in the music (sometimes) invited thoughts and images of people in distress or competition and chase.","Memories of being on the beach and of sailing. Walking on the deck with crisp air and comfortable breezes. My shawl blowing in the breeze. Feeling calm and relaxed but also like I could do anything. Hopeful and content at the same time.","It was a memory of a loss in my life, the loss of the love of my life.","Only one air traffic controller remains at JFK airport because all the rest were laid off. He is scrambling to run all functions and there is complete chaos.","This movement conjured a field of flowers in my mind. More specifically, it's an open field of grass with lots of small flowers (daisies, buttercups perhaps). I also imagined a clear sky in the background.","A long time ago I heard this piece for the first time. Went in one ear and out the other. Same (mostly) the other times I've heard it. This time I was shattered. It was beautifully played, true but more, I'm old and hearing this and feeling my heart breaking, I realized something I hadn't quite before. You change much faster when you're old than when you're young.","I played the violin part of the Beethoven in an amateur quartet.","Contemplation of sad things — the current state of the world, especially war, death and grief.","Thinking of my husband who died. Marcel Proust, his specialty, losses, and sadnesses too. Personal to me particular losing my diamond, car crash when my daughter was 3, etc. H4,.","Memories were almost absent, but I did think back on a good class with rare books, and how much the students enjoyed seeing them.","Thoughts of my grandmother and her life — sadness and happiness around her family.","Beautiful long breath line.

But the major section following brought to mind people marching proudly by day. The alternation of these themes grew to suggest an entire population, a national struggle of some kind. The finale continued this feeling.","The beginning of the third movement brought to mind a parade on horseback in San Miguel de Allende in Mexico, celebrating Mexican Independence Day September 16, 1969. I remember the date very well because I spent most of that month in San Miguel, right before I moved to Princeton.","Dramatic music reminds me of dramatic art — seeing strong, powerful pieces — Goya in the Prado, the dramatic size of Whistlejacket at the National Gallery....Powerful music brings to mind great scenes — Winston Churchill speeches, key moments in battles, etc.","2 people dancing dramatically, stairs in a luxurious building, red carpet.","Our hero rides on horseback, at first jauntily, then more urgently, as he is being pursued by a foe. The urgency builds, until the foe is dangerously close. Then in a moment, our hero breaks away in triumph. (Alas, this all played out again at the recapitulation).","Thought about my own experiences performing in concert band. Very easy to sway along\u002f move to the tempo of the beat. Brahms holds a place in my mind — I remember playing autumn-inspired piece (don't remember its name unfortunately) in high school. Brahms ...

Watching everything go by and seeing NY come into view — exciting for me because I grew up in New York. Thinking of the excitement of Penn Station and the excitement of New York itself....Same as before.","Triumph of good over evil.","I was remembering and comparing this performance with other performances of the same piece. I remembered vividly a different pianist looking at the quartet players very frequently — just as the members of the Takács Quartet looked at each other during the Beethoven tonight. And the music of the scherzo struck me as if a world was breaking apart.","The third is a Brahms gallop, very powerful, and I am overwhelmed by its power, but it does not evoke memory.","I had read the notes in the program, so I was thinking about Clara Schumann and her critique of an earlier version of the piece — so I imagined her writing the letter urging Brahms to revise it again.","Sounded like horses galloping. Moving toward a target. Militaristic — like being in a cavalry.","A late night moonlit scene in a forest. A lone rider on a horse galloping towards a destination. The moonlight blanketing the trees and illuminating the path. The scent of sweat and pines. Animals scurrying through the underbrush. The horse slowing down as the rider nears a pond. The stars reflected in the water. The horse drinks cool water while the rider contemplates the stars and his fate.","The tempo gives rise to some scene with intensity. Like racing, arguing, activities of mind forces.","Evokes feelings of a victory parade\u002fmarch.","This reminded me of a climax of a movie\u002fstory such as Perfect Storm where ultimate survival or doom were uncertain and competing thoughts.","Another time I heard this piece played in concert.","A memory of a Yak race in Southern China, the riders were very excited.","This was the most vivid movement, in which I was paying the most attention. During the interplay of piano and viola, I imagined them talking to one another (the instruments).","Racing horses, a chase scene.","Playing by the stream at my family's farm after a heavy rain-swollen stream flowing over long grass, the field, the tiny sticks traveling down the stream....Either sunset or before a storm, yellow orange sky behind a hill and a tree — a dark purple flower or dark green leaves — purple like velvet or silk. Water! Rain! Lots of water!","I had a vague memory of driving across central Ohio in the winter.","The march music brought memories of films where there were march scenes....Political or military scenes in movies.","A ball rolls and rolls and accumulates matter and grows and grows. It is sticky. Eventually the ball has extensions growing out of it angrily growing 1 finally expanding from itself rather than from accumulating stuff that it rolls in.","No particularly strong memories. Some work related stress. Similarly thought about stressful interactions at work with coworkers....Very intense storm over a desert (either movement 2 or 3). Turbulent clouds. Rain.","No specific memory, really. Just a very tense movement, so made me think of walking on a balance beam...","The rapid rhythm of the music brought back a memory of dancing wildly around — as well as a raunchy experience. Unlike the first half of the program however, the Brahms did not evoke as much \"imagining\"....Again the rapid rhythm prompted a scene of horse racing.","A prince is riding a horse and is in a rush. Not to save people. Probably in urgency to see someone. The story didn't go on because the piece ended in a sudden (didn't feel like it was the end).","Brahms was the first classical composer I fell in love with; this and his string sextet accompanied me on a long drive once to my dear friends Shawn and Lauren, on a frigid January day a few years ago; Perfect music for a 95 minute drive to Mahwah. I played this movement for them; they marveled at its modernity.","Memory of reading a biography of Brahms and his stormy life!","A great processional.","Herds of wild horses dispersing, then coming together again. Sometimes running in horse races with riders on their backs.","We have a dog — a cavapoo who stands up on her hind legs and twirls around when she wants a treat. I pictured her dancing around the kitchen, then she went and ran in circles in the backyard. Last of all she ran along the Delaware canal and chased geese. At last she saw Donald trump and bit him on the behind.","I imagined Clara Schumann playing the piano with a quartet.","Just marvelous music, thrills every time I hear it! Memories of many previous encounters!","A story of Erlkönig came to mind during the third movement, a scene where a father was taking his sick child to see a doctor. The piano resembled a galloping horse. The music reminded me of Schubert's Erlkönig.","I was an animal, likely a horse galloping along a grassy lane lined with large, lichen-covered oak trees. Beyond the trees, were fake, wooden ocean waves and boats, like you would see in a theater set, moving slowly up and down.","Takács another time — exciting.","The scherzo has been one of my favorite pieces since I was a teenager and I listen to it often. The last time I saw it performed was by faculty at a summer music camp I attended when I was 16. I kept thinking about the summer camp even though those memories in general don't 'match' the music.","In the march-like sections, I was reminded of my college graduation — of processing down the aisle to the ceremonial music.","I imagined Icelandic wild horses running free surrounded by waterfalls and green canyons.","Dancing in a ballroom.","I imagined making various travel plans for later this year. A road trip in Northern California. A solo trip to Marrakech. Among others.","There was some timing issues between the piano and quartet which reminded me of playing Brahms 2 piano music with my partner and the difficulty of nailing Brahms' metrical and rhythmic clashes. I remember the practice room vividly.","Life is full of ups and downs but there is beauty in each moment to be had.","Traveling with family, children young-.","I imagined receiving a message to reconnect from the first love I reminisced about during the same movement.
